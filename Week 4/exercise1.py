# The operator += adds the value after the = to the variable
# The operator -= subtracts the number to the variable
# The *= operator multiplies the variable times the number that comes after
# The /= divides the number creating, if needed transforming the variable into boolean type
# The %= operator prompts the remainder from dividing the variable by the number
# The == operator reassigns the variable to whatever comes after the ==
# Lastly, the // operator discard the decimal part from a non-integer result division
