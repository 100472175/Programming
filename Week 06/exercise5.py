Exercise 5

Instructions: Write a program that guesses the number that the user has thought (1 to 100). The program will generate
 random numbers and must control that none of them is repeated. It will also be able to detect if the user is lying
 (if it has already tried all the numbers and the user says it is none of them). It has also to count how many attempts
  were needed to guess the number.
